## Plan: Next.js Product Showcase Landing Page

Create a fresh Next.js + TypeScript project in the current folder, add styled-components and react-icons, and implement a responsive product showcase landing page with category sections, promo codes, and WhatsApp buy links. Structure components under src/components with .tsx, .styles.ts, and .interface.ts files, then configure static export and GitHub Pages deployment.

### Steps
1. Scaffold Next.js app in the current root folder with TypeScript and src directory.
2. Install and configure styled-components and react-icons support.
3. Create the ProductShowcase component structure in src/components with .tsx, .styles.ts, .interface.ts.
4. Build category sections with products, promo code display, WhatsApp buy links, and “load more”.
5. Configure static export and GitHub Pages deployment settings.

### Further Considerations
1. Confirm WhatsApp phone number and message format for the buy link.
2. Confirm whether product images are local assets or remote URLs.
3. Confirm desired GitHub Pages base path (repo name).
